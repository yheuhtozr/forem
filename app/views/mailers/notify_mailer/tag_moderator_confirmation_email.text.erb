Hey <%= @user.name %>!

Thanks for volunteering to be a <%= community_name %> tag moderator. We’ve added you as a moderator for <%= tag_url(@tag) %>. Note that your profile picture is now visible on this page.

As a tag moderator, you are able to:

- Remove #<%= @tag %> if it’s been added to an irrelevant post.
- Add #<%= @tag %> to posts if applicable.
- Update the #<%= @tag %> tag landing page, including submission guidelines and design visible in the sidebar.

For details on all available features and how to access them, visit our tag moderation page.

To aid in communication, we’ve added you to the following <%= community_name %> Connect channels:

- Tag Moderators <%= app_url("/connect/tag-moderators") %>
- #<%= @tag %>

You can use these channels to meet other tag moderators across the site and co-moderators within your tag while coordinating with the <%= community_name %> team.
When in doubt about how to exercise your new privileges, please ask! If these Connect channels become too distracting, you can mute or leave any channel as you wish.

Tag moderation is something we're continuously iterating on, so you can expect adjustments and expanding features over time as we receive feedback.
We regularly send out a biweekly Mod Newsletter to keep mods up to date on these changes, so look out for it!
Of course, don't hesitate to reach out to us at any moment if you have any feedback — feel free to write to <%= ForemInstance.email %> and share your thoughts.

Thanks so much for volunteering your time to benefit <%= community_name %>. We sincerely appreciate your help!

Happy Modding!
<%= community_name %> Team
