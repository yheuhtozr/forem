  # Helps filter a `:users_scope` to those authorized to the `:action`.  I want a list of all users
  # who can create an Article.  This policy method can help with that.
  #
  # @param users_scope [ActiveRecord::Relation] a scope for querying user objects
  # @param action [Symbol] the name of one of the ArticlePolicy action predicates (e.g. :create?,
  #        :new?) though as a convenience, we will also accept :new, and :create.

  # @return [ActiveRecord::Relation]

  # @see https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Scoping/Named/ClassMethods.html#method-i-scope
  #
  # @note With this duplication it would be feasible to alter the instance method logics to use the
  #       class method (e.g. `ArticlePolicy.scope_authorized(users_scope: User, action:
  #       :create?).find_by(user.id)`) but that's a future consideration.
  #
  # @note This is not a Pundit scope (see https://github.com/varvet/pundit#scopes), as those methods
  #       are for answering "What articles can I see?"  This method is for answering "Who all can
  #       <action> on Articles?"
  #
  # @note Why isn't this a User.scope method?  Because the logic of who can take an action on the
  #       resource is the problem domain of the policy.

  # @note [@jeremyf] I am re-implemnenting the initialize method, but removing the Pundit
  #       authorization.  There's an assumption that all policy questions will require a user,
  #       unless you know specifically that they don't.
  #
  # @note as a reminder, if you attempt to authorize this policy in a controller with that calls
  #       {CachingHeaders#set_cache_control_headers} you may encounter some headaches.  What do
  #       those headaches look like?  When you call {CachingHeaders#set_cache_control_headers}, you
  #       are likely disallowing checks on current_user (via {EdgeCacheSafetyCheck#current_user}).
  #
  # @todo [@jeremyf] I don't like altering the initializer and its core assumption.  But the other
  #       option to get Articles working for https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16529 is to
  #       address the at present fundamental assumption regarding "Policies are for authorizing when
  #       you have a user, otherwise let the controller decide."
