  # @note [@jeremyf] I am re-implemnenting the initialize method, but removing the Pundit
  #       authorization.  There's an assumption that all policy questions will require a user,
  #       unless you know specifically that they don't.
  #
  # @note as a reminder, if you attempt to authorize this policy in a controller with that calls
  #       {CachingHeaders#set_cache_control_headers} you may encounter some headaches.  What do
  #       those headaches look like?  When you call {CachingHeaders#set_cache_control_headers}, you
  #       are likely disallowing checks on current_user (via {EdgeCacheSafetyCheck#current_user}).
  #
  # @todo [@jeremyf] I don't like altering the initializer and its core assumption.  But the other
  #       option to get Articles working for https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/16529 is to
  #       address the at present fundamental assumption regarding "Policies are for authorizing when
  #       you have a user, otherwise let the controller decide."

  #
  # @note As part of our aspirations to only show users what is relevant to them and "hiding" what
  #       is not, this method will help us with the edge case of "should we show the user a
  #       dashboard listing of posts?"

  #       toggled on the feature limiting posts to admins only) but they have at least one published
  #       post.  In that case we want to show them things like "their posts's analytics" or a
  #       dashboard of their published posts.

  # @note This policy method is a bit different.  It is strictly meant to return true or false.
  #       Other policies might raise exceptions, but the purpose of this method is for conditional
