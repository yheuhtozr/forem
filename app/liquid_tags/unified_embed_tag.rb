# This liquid tag is present to facilitate a unified user experience
# for declaring that they want a URL to have "embedded" behavior.
#
# What do we mean by embedded behavior?  A more contextually rich
# rendering of the URL, instead of a simple "A-tag".
#
# @see https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/15099 for details on the
#      purpose of this class.
class UnifiedEmbedTag < LiquidTagBase

  # using this class as a lookup (e.g., Factory pattern?) for the
  # LiquidTagBase instance that is applicable for the given :link.
  #
  # @param tag_name [String] in the UI, this was liquid tag name
  #        (e.g., `{% tag_name link %}`)
  # @param link [String] the URL and additional options for that

  # @param parse_context [Liquid::ParseContext]
