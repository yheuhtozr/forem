# Buttons

Buttons are clickable elements that are used to trigger actions. 
They communicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages in a variety of ways. 
Button labels express what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

 It is therefore very important that the different variants are implemented consistently across product, 
 so that they message the correct actions.

## CTAs vs Links vs Buttons

The most important of these rules is that the `<CTA />` (or `<Link />`) and `<Button />` elements are assigned to appropriate respective tasks. 
That is: `<CTA />` or `<Link />` should be used where navigation is elicited, and `<Button />` where a non-navigational action is being invoked.
For example, a 'Submit' control on 'Sign in' view (form) would suit a `<Button />` because its job is to submit the form. 
However, 'Register' call-to-action—taking the user to a different form, in a different page or screen—would benefit from `<CTA />` or `<Link />` semantics.

Do not use `<Button />s` as navigational elements. Instead, use Links (or CTAs) when the desired action is to take the user to a new page.

## Variants

### Primary

Primary button has special look: high contrast (against rest of the view/component) and it's filled with accent color. 

Ideally there should be only one Primary button per entire component, or sometimes even per entire view.
Primary buttons should be used for the principal call to action on the page.

### Default

Default variant is less prominent, and therefore can be used for less prominent actions.
Default buttons are visually light (greyish) and you can have as many of them as you want (within common sense :D). 
They can (but don't have to) be used in conjunction with a Primary button. In that case, default variant should be used for any remaining actions.

## Configuration

### Destructive actions

For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data (for example, *delete* or *remove*) we have a special style.
This style can be applied by using `destructive` prop and it will work for both: primary and default variants. Take care when using the default variant to ensure that the red text has sufficient color contrast against the background where you are using it.

### Icons

Icon can be placed in front of a label to both clarify an action and call attention to a button. 
By passing an object in `icon` prop, there will be automatically included `<Icon />` component.
By default, the icon itself won't be customizable. Icons within buttons are hidden from assistive technology, so make sure your button has descriptive enough text, or is otherwise well-labelled (e.g. with `aria-label`).

#### Icon-only

There are certain instances where an icon will suffice in place of a text label, but use these cautiously.
Icon-only buttons should always use clear and obvious icon, ideally accompanied by a tooltip or title. Make sure your button is adequately labelled for assistive technologies, either by the tooltip or by an `aria-label`.

##### Fully rounded

In most cases, whenever we display icon-only buttons (standalone, not in a *buttons group*) we tend to make button fully rounded - use `rounded` prop for that.
Other than that please avoid customizing border-radius on buttons.

### Tooltip

By passing a string or node in `tooltip` prop, button will get a custom tooltip (visually different than a classic `title`) on `:hover` and `:focus`. The tooltip makes up part of the "accessible name" used by assistive technologies like screen readers. If you _do not_ wish the tooltip to be part of the accessible name, consider wrapping it in a `<span aria-hidden="true">`. Tooltips can be temporarily dismissed on `Escape` key press.
