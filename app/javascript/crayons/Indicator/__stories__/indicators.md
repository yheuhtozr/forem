## Indicators

Indicators are meant to be used to inform user about, for example, unread
notifications. They supposed to steal user&apos;s attention and make him notice
or click specific element.

We should keep in mind to never show too many indicators at the same time. Use
your best judgment. There are two types of indicators:

- Rectangle with label (text or number)
- Bullet - just a circle without any text on it.

And there arere four styles to pick from:

- Default (grey) - nothing really crucial, basic information about something.

- Accent (blueish) - something we want user to be aware of but it&apos;s also
  not crucial information

- Critical (red) - something super important, don&apos;t overuse it!!

- Inverted (dark grey) - alternative to the default one, especially when we need
  to show two default indicators next to each other.
