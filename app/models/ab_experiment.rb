# This object wraps the FieldTest logic to provide a bit of insulation

class AbExperiment < SimpleDelegator
  # Don't allow someone to circumvent the .get class method.  I want
  # to follow the Law of Demeter and require that we us the @api
  # public
  private_class_method :new

  # @api public
  #
  # A convenience method to insulate against the implementation
  # details of the field_test gem.
  #
  # @param experiment [Symbol] the named method we'll call for an
  #        experiment.  It should be a method name defined on this
  #        object.
  # @param controller [ApplicationController] the request context of
  #        the experiment.
  # @note We need the controller object due to the implementation of
  #       the `field_test` method.  The `field_test` method is defined
  #       in the FieldTest::Helpers module.  If we have a user, the
  #       field_test method works great with just the
  #       FieldTest::Helpers methods.  However, if we don't have a
  #       user, then the field_test method calls
  #       `field_test_participant` which is defined in the
  #       `FieldTest::Controller` (which calls the `request` and
  #       `cookies`).
  # @param user [User] who are we running the experiment with
  # @param config [Hash] container for possible ENV override of strategy.
  # @param default_value [Object] the caller is making decisions based
  #        on a configured set of values.  They know which one they
  #        likely want.  Let them give us a hint.
  #
  # @return [Object] the experimenter should know what it wants
  #
  # @see config/field_test.yml file for configured experiments.
  #
  # @note You can force a named strategy by setting an ENV variable.
  #       This forced strategy might be super useful for anyone performing
  #       QA testing on AB Testing scenarios.
  #
  # @todo If we make heavy use of this class, consider guarding for
  #       valid experiment methods.
