# Sign in with Apple Authentication

Forem allows you to authenticate using
[Sign in with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/sign-in-with-apple/). In order
to use this authentication method you'll need to be enrolled to the
[Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) in order to
retrieve the necessary credentials and an HTTPS supported URL for the callback
configuration (HTTP won't work). Then you'll need to provide the keys to the
Rails application.

# Apple Developer Portal Configuration

[Register/Sign in](https://developer.apple.com/account) to your Apple Developer
Account.

## Service ID Configuration

1. [Create a Service ID](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/list/serviceId)

![Create Service ID](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6045239/92610177-a5cc9e00-f274-11ea-9f63-20d8356d0bee.png)

2. Name the Service and finalize the registration

3. Configure Domains and Subdomains & the callback URL. This example uses
   [ngrok](https://ngrok.io) for HTTPS support.

## Key Configuration

1. [Register a new Key](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/authkeys/add).
   Enable the "Sign in with Apple" option and configure it so it's associated
   with the corresponding App ID

2. Download the Key

![Download the Key](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6045239/92611466-0f00e100-f276-11ea-912d-f8a74b6dfb04.png)

# Configuring the Rails Application

Now with both the Service ID and Key you'll need to enable Apple Authentication
and pass in the credentials in the admin dashboard
`/admin/customization/config`.

Add the corresponding configuration data. Make sure the PEM key you downloaded
has explicit linebreaks (`\n`), don't forget the one at the very end of it.

Save the changes and restart your server for these values to take effect.

## Email configuration

Apple uses what they call Private Email Relay Service to hide user's emails. For
this to work first
[create a new email source](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/services/list).

Emails sent need to be authenticated and the configuration depends on the
different providers available:

- [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/help/set-up-custom-domain-authentication-dkim-and-spf/)
- [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/docs/ui/account-and-settings/how-to-set-up-domain-authentication/)
- [SES](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/es_es/ses/latest/DeveloperGuide/send-email-authentication-dkim.html)
