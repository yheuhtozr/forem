# Push Notifications Delivery

Forem instances rely on [Rpush](https://github.com/rpush/rpush) to deliver push
notifications. This decision was heavily influenced by the desire to provide as
much flexibility as possible to Creators. In order to do this, Forem instances
can register and configure a `ConsumerApp`.

These consumer apps represent mobile applications that users use to browse and
consume content on a Forem. Authenticated users of a specific Forem instance can
register a `Device` associated to a `ConsumerApp`. With these pieces we are able
to deliver push notifications to users devices.

The `ConsumerApp` configuration page can be found at
`/admin/apps/consumer_apps`. The official Forem apps are supported by default
and require their secret credential to be provided via ENV variable.

## Rpush Implementation

We use Rpush's `rpush-redis` implementation (read
[this thread](https://github.com/forem/forem/pull/12419/files#r564660917) for
the reasons why), hence all `Rpush` models are persisted in Redis. More details
about how this works [here](https://github.com/rpush/rpush/wiki/Using-Redis).
